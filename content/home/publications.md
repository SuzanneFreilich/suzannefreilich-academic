**A genetic history of the pre-contact Caribbean**

Fernandes, D.M., ..., Freilich, S., ..., Reich, D. 

Nature    23 Dec 2020: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03053-2 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03053-2/ "Nature")

*Abstract*

Humans settled the Caribbean about 6,000 years ago, and ceramic use and intensified agriculture mark a shift from the Archaic to the Ceramic Age at around 2,500 years ago. Here we report genome-wide data from 174 ancient individuals from The Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic (collectively, Hispaniola), Puerto Rico, Curaçao and Venezuela, which we co-analysed with 89 previously published ancient individuals. Stone-tool-using Caribbean people, who first entered the Caribbean during the Archaic Age, derive from a deeply divergent population that is closest to Central and northern South American individuals; contrary to previous work4, we find no support for ancestry contributed by a population related to North American individuals. Archaic-related lineages were >98% replaced by a genetically homogeneous ceramic-using population related to speakers of languages in the Arawak family from northeast South America; these people moved through the Lesser Antilles and into the Greater Antilles at least 1,700 years ago, introducing ancestry that is still present. Ancient Caribbean people avoided close kin unions despite limited mate pools that reflect small effective population sizes, which we estimate to be a minimum of 500–1,500 and a maximum of 1,530–8,150 individuals on the combined islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the dozens of generations before the individuals who we analysed lived. Census sizes are unlikely to be more than tenfold larger than effective population sizes, so previous pan-Caribbean estimates of hundreds of thousands of people are too large5,6. Confirming a small and interconnected Ceramic Age population7, we detect 19 pairs of cross-island cousins, close relatives buried around 75 km apart in Hispaniola and low genetic differentiation across islands. Genetic continuity across transitions in pottery styles reveals that cultural changes during the Ceramic Age were not driven by migration of genetically differentiated groups from the mainland, but instead reflected interactions within an interconnected Caribbean world.

**The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia**

Science  06 Sep 2019: Vol. 365, Issue 6457, eaat7487, [DOI: 10.1126/science.aat7487](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487.abstract?casa_token=bRrVNmrqFLYAAAAA:UuKIxMw3laWpvZRur13p2wpAh5v3DYWX-CE1wow_fJc3RMmOoDXaI9TCkDdnDs1wxUgUQULYsc8Nsg/ "Science")

*Abstract*

By sequencing 523 ancient humans, we show that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Asians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. After the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, its people mixed with individuals in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia, whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who, starting around 4000 years ago, spread via Central Asia to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the distinctive features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.

*Abstract*

The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is widely distributed along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands. Like other pinnipeds, they suffered from severe exploitation during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, causing population declines of over 90%. Small effective population sizes are predicted to carry less genetic diversity than larger ones. Island populations are also predicted to carry less genetic variation than their mainland counterparts due to the magnified effects of stochastic genetic processes. Levels of intra-population genetic diversity were assessed by direct sequencing of a 457 base pair fragment from the 5' mitochondrial tRNA<sup>thr</sup> control region in thirty-nine samples from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina and the adjacent Falkland Islands. Eighteen haplotypes were characterized by twenty-four variable sites and distributed equally between the two locations. Allelic diversity was high, however nucleotide diversity in the island population was approximately half that found in Argentina. Estimated long-term female effective population size was higher than in most wild populations, and the magnitude of the population decline was not severe enough to cause genetic diversity to drop to critical levels. Predicted levels of gene flow and
philopatry were also tested by analysis of population genetic structure. Wright's fixation index indicated strong genetic structuring (28% divergence), however evolutionary relationships revealed little patterning. An ancient population expansion characterizing the Falkland Islands indicates that it may have acted as a Pleistocene glacial island refugium, resulting in mixing of preglacial populations. Moderate levels of migration promoted by thermoregulatory requirements sustained a connection between the two populations until recent times, with highly philopatric behaviour characterizing presentday sea lion populations. Increasing interactions with fisheries and other anthropogenic disturbances continue to threaten these populations, and the results support the classification of the two populations as a single management unit for the purposes of conservation management.
