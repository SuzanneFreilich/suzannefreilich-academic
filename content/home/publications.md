**Reconstructing genetic histories and social organisation in Neolithic and Bronze Age Croatia**

Freilich, S., Ringbauer, H., Los, D. et al. 

Scientific Reports 11, 16729,  18 Aug 2021: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94932-9 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94932-9/ "Scientific Reports")

*Abstract*

Ancient DNA studies have revealed how human migrations from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age transformed the social and genetic structure of European societies. Present-day Croatia lies at the heart of ancient migration routes through Europe, yet our knowledge about social and genetic processes here remains sparse. To shed light on these questions, we report new whole-genome data for 28 individuals dated to between ~ 4700 BCE–400 CE from two sites in present-day eastern Croatia. In the Middle Neolithic we evidence first cousin mating practices and strong genetic continuity from the Early Neolithic. In the Middle Bronze Age community that we studied, we find multiple closely related males suggesting a patrilocal social organisation. We also find in that community an unexpected genetic ancestry profile distinct from individuals found at contemporaneous sites in the region, due to the addition of hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. These findings support archaeological evidence for contacts with communities further north in the Carpathian Basin. Finally, an individual dated to Roman times exhibits an ancestry profile that is broadly present in the region today, adding an important data point to the substantial shift in ancestry that occurred in the region between the Bronze Age and today.


**Large-scale migration into Britain during the Middle to Late Bronze Age**

Patterson, N., …., Freilich, S., …, Reich, D.  

Nature 22 Dec 2021 (Advanced Article Preview): [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-04287-4 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04287-4/ "Nature")

*Abstract*

Present-day people from England and Wales harbour more ancestry derived from Early European Farmers (EEF) than people of the Early Bronze Age1. To understand this, we generated genome-wide data from 793 individuals, increasing data from the Middle to Late Bronze and Iron Age in Britain by 12-fold, and Western and Central Europe by 3.5-fold. Between 1000 and 875 BC, EEF ancestry increased in southern Britain (England and Wales) but not northern Britain (Scotland) due to incorporation of migrants who arrived at this time and over previous centuries, and who were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from France. These migrants contributed about half the ancestry of Iron Age people of England and Wales, thereby creating a plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain. These patterns are part of a broader trend of EEF ancestry becoming more similar across central and western Europe in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, coincident with archaeological evidence of intensified cultural exchange2–6. There was comparatively less gene flow from continental Europe during the Iron Age, and Britain’s independent genetic trajectory is also reflected in the rise of the allele conferring lactase persistence to ~50% by this time compared to ~7% in central Europe where it rose rapidly in frequency only a millennium later. This suggests that dairy products were used in qualitatively different ways in Britain and in central Europe over this period.


**Genomic insights into the formation of human populations in East Asia**

Wang, C.C., ..., Freilich, S., ..., Reich, D.

Nature  22 Feb 2021: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03336-2 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03336-2/ "Nature")

*Abstract*

The deep population history of East Asia remains poorly understood due to a lack of ancient DNA data and sparse sampling of present-day people. We report genome-wide data from 166 East Asians dating to 6000 BCE – 1000 CE and 46 present-day groups. Hunter-gatherers from Japan, the Amur River Basin, and people of Neolithic and Iron Age Taiwan and the Tibetan plateau are linked by a deeply-splitting lineage likely reflecting a Late Pleistocene coastal migration. We follow Holocene expansions from four regions. First, hunter-gatherers of Mongolia and the Amur River Basin have ancestry shared by Mongolic and Tungusic language speakers but do not carry West Liao River farmer ancestry contradicting theories that their expansion spread these proto-languages. Second, Yellow River Basin farmers at ~3000 BCE likely spread Sino-Tibetan languages as their ancestry dispersed both to Tibet where it forms up ~84% to some groups and to the Central Plain where it contributed ~59-84% to Han Chinese. Third, people from Taiwan ~1300 BCE to 800 CE derived ~75% ancestry from a lineage also common in modern Austronesian, Tai-Kadai and Austroasiatic speakers likely deriving from Yangtze River Valley farmers; ancient Taiwan people also derived ~25% ancestry from a northern lineage related to but different from Yellow River farmers implying an additional north-to-south expansion. Fourth, Yamnaya Steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived in western Mongolia after ~3000 BCE but was displaced by previously established lineages even while it persisted in western China as expected if it spread the ancestor of Tocharian Indo-European languages. Two later gene flows affected western Mongolia: after ~2000 BCE migrants with Yamnaya and European farmer ancestry, and episodic impacts of later groups with ancestry from Turan.


**A genetic history of the pre-contact Caribbean**

Fernandes, D.M., ..., Freilich, S., ..., Reich, D. 

Nature    23 Dec 2020: [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-03053-2 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03053-2/ "Nature")

*Abstract*

Humans settled the Caribbean about 6,000 years ago, and ceramic use and intensified agriculture mark a shift from the Archaic to the Ceramic Age at around 2,500 years ago. Here we report genome-wide data from 174 ancient individuals from The Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic (collectively, Hispaniola), Puerto Rico, Curaçao and Venezuela, which we co-analysed with 89 previously published ancient individuals. Stone-tool-using Caribbean people, who first entered the Caribbean during the Archaic Age, derive from a deeply divergent population that is closest to Central and northern South American individuals; contrary to previous work4, we find no support for ancestry contributed by a population related to North American individuals. Archaic-related lineages were >98% replaced by a genetically homogeneous ceramic-using population related to speakers of languages in the Arawak family from northeast South America; these people moved through the Lesser Antilles and into the Greater Antilles at least 1,700 years ago, introducing ancestry that is still present. Ancient Caribbean people avoided close kin unions despite limited mate pools that reflect small effective population sizes, which we estimate to be a minimum of 500–1,500 and a maximum of 1,530–8,150 individuals on the combined islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the dozens of generations before the individuals who we analysed lived. Census sizes are unlikely to be more than tenfold larger than effective population sizes, so previous pan-Caribbean estimates of hundreds of thousands of people are too large5,6. Confirming a small and interconnected Ceramic Age population7, we detect 19 pairs of cross-island cousins, close relatives buried around 75 km apart in Hispaniola and low genetic differentiation across islands. Genetic continuity across transitions in pottery styles reveals that cultural changes during the Ceramic Age were not driven by migration of genetically differentiated groups from the mainland, but instead reflected interactions within an interconnected Caribbean world.



**The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia**

Narasimhan, V.M., ..., Freilich, S., ..., Reich, D.

Science  06 Sep 2019: Vol. 365, Issue 6457, eaat7487, [DOI: 10.1126/science.aat7487](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487.abstract?casa_token=bRrVNmrqFLYAAAAA:UuKIxMw3laWpvZRur13p2wpAh5v3DYWX-CE1wow_fJc3RMmOoDXaI9TCkDdnDs1wxUgUQULYsc8Nsg/ "Science")

*Abstract*

By sequencing 523 ancient humans, we show that the primary source of ancestry in modern South Asians is a prehistoric genetic gradient between people related to early hunter-gatherers of Iran and Southeast Asia. After the Indus Valley Civilization's decline, its people mixed with individuals in the southeast to form one of the two main ancestral populations of South Asia, whose direct descendants live in southern India. Simultaneously, they mixed with descendants of Steppe pastoralists who, starting around 4000 years ago, spread via Central Asia to form the other main ancestral population. The Steppe ancestry in South Asia has the same profile as that in Bronze Age Eastern Europe, tracking a movement of people that affected both regions and that likely spread the distinctive features shared between Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.



**Genetic diversity and population genetic structure in the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens).**

Freilich, S., A. R. Hoelzel, and S. R. Choudhury. 

Durham Anthropology Journal 2005:13(1) {{% staticref "media/PosterPresentation.pdf" "newtab" %}}View poster{{% /staticref %}}

*Abstract*

The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) is widely distributed along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands. Like other pinnipeds, they suffered from severe exploitation during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, causing population declines of over 90%. Small effective population sizes are predicted to carry less genetic diversity than larger ones. Island populations are also predicted to carry less genetic variation than their mainland counterparts due to the magnified effects of stochastic genetic processes. Levels of intra-population genetic diversity were assessed by direct sequencing of a 457 base pair fragment from the 5' mitochondrial tRNA<sup>thr</sup> control region in thirty-nine samples from Peninsula Valdes, Argentina and the adjacent Falkland Islands. Eighteen haplotypes were characterized by twenty-four variable sites and distributed equally between the two locations. Allelic diversity was high, however nucleotide diversity in the island population was approximately half that found in Argentina. Estimated long-term female effective population size was higher than in most wild populations, and the magnitude of the population decline was not severe enough to cause genetic diversity to drop to critical levels. Predicted levels of gene flow and
philopatry were also tested by analysis of population genetic structure. Wright's fixation index indicated strong genetic structuring (28% divergence), however evolutionary relationships revealed little patterning. An ancient population expansion characterizing the Falkland Islands indicates that it may have acted as a Pleistocene glacial island refugium, resulting in mixing of preglacial populations. Moderate levels of migration promoted by thermoregulatory requirements sustained a connection between the two populations until recent times, with highly philopatric behaviour characterizing presentday sea lion populations. Increasing interactions with fisheries and other anthropogenic disturbances continue to threaten these populations, and the results support the classification of the two populations as a single management unit for the purposes of conservation management.
