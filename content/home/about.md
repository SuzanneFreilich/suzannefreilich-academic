I am interested in combining archaeology, anthropology and biomarkers to understand biological and cultural human evolution.

My working research title is "Genetic diversity and social stratification in prehistoric Balkans: Genes, culture and the rise of complex societies." This involves generation of whole genomes, together with carbon, nitrogen and strontium stable isotope signatures to better understand the genetic and social structuring of Neolithic and Bronze Age assemblages from the Balkans. I am also interested in the spread and evolution of ancient pathogens as well as the study of dental calculus which provides insights into the oral microbiome.
