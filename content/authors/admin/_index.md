I am interested in combining archaeology, anthropology and biomarkers to understand biological and cultural human evolution.

I sequence and analyse whole genomes from ancient individuals, together with carbon, nitrogen and strontium stable isotope signatures to better understand prehistoric communities' genetic and social structures, and patterns of diet and mobility. I am also interested in the spread and evolution of ancient pathogens, as well as the analysis of dental calculus which provides insights into the ancient oral microbiome.
