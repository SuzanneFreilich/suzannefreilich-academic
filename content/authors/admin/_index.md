I am interested in combining archaeology, anthropology and biomarkers to understand biological and cultural human evolution.
I generate and analyse whole genomes from ancient individuals, together with carbon, nitrogen and strontium stable isotope signatures to better understand the genetic and social structures of prehistoric communities. In addition, the analysis of calculus provides insights into the oral microbiome.
